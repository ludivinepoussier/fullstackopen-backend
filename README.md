# fullstackopen-backend
## by Ludivine Poussier

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises for the backend part (part 3, phonebook app) from the Course [Full
Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about), held by the [Department of Computer
Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/computer-science) at the University of
Helsinki, Finland.

To have a look at my solutions for the other exercises from this course, go to this [repository](https://github.com/ludivinepoussier/fullstackopen).

The Phonebook app on which I'm still working on can be found here: https://cryptic-peak-52730.herokuapp.com/
